# Angular 18 Server Side Rendering 

This project illustrates a potential methodology for utilizing Angular 18 in conjunction with server-side rendering (SSR).

## What is Server Side Rendering (SSR)?

Server Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique used to render web pages on the server instead of in the browser. This can improve the performance and SEO of your web application.

## Benefits of SSR

- **Improved Performance**: SSR can improve the initial load time of your application.
- **SEO Friendly**: SSR makes it easier for search engines to crawl and index your web pages.
- **Faster Time-to-Interactive**: Users can see the content faster, improving the overall user experience.
